        <p><em>These dumplings are the Piero-key to my heart.</em></p> 
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Perogi are traditional Eastern European dumplings that are 
            typically filled with mashed potatoes and cheese, but can 
            also be filled with other ingredients such as ground meat, 
            sauerkraut, or fruit. Here is a recipe for perogi filled 
            with mashed potatoes and cheese that makes about 50 dumplings:</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>3/4 cup water</li>
            <li>2 cups mashed potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: sour cream, chives, bacon bits, saut√©ed onions</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the flour and salt. Add the egg and water and mix until 
                a soft dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add a little more water, 1 tablespoon at 
                a time. If the dough is too wet, add a little more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes until it is smooth and 
                elastic. Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the mashed potatoes, cheese, butter, and salt and pepper. 
                Set aside.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. Using 
                a 3-inch round cookie cutter or the rim of a glass, cut out circles from the dough.</li>
            <li>Place about 1 tablespoon of the potato filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold 
                the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape and press the edges together to seal. 
                Place the perogi on a lightly floured surface and cover with a clean kitchen towel while 
                you repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully add the perogi to the pot, being 
                sure not to overcrowd the pot. Cook the perogi in batches if necessary. Cook the perogi 
                for 3-4 minutes or until they float to the surface.</li>
        </ol>
