        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Peking duck is a Chinese dish that is traditionally made by roasting a 
            whole duck to perfection and then slicing it into thin, crispy pieces. 
            Here is a recipe for Peking duck that serves 4-6 people:</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole duck, about 4-5 lbs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Chinese five-spice powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.</li>
            <li>Rinse the duck and pat dry with paper towels. In a small bowl, mix 
                together the Chinese five-spice powder, salt, soy sauce, honey, 
                and sesame oil. Rub the mixture all over the outside and inside 
                of the duck.</li>
            <li>Place the duck on a wire rack in a roasting pan. Add the water 
                to the bottom of the pan. Roast the duck in the preheated oven 
                for 1 hour and 45 minutes, or until the skin is crisp and golden 
                brown.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the honey, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, 
                and sesame oil to make the glaze. Brush the glaze over the duck and 
                continue to roast for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the glaze 
                is caramelized and the duck is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove the duck from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before 
                slicing. Slice the duck into thin pieces and serve with the pancakes, 
                scallions, cucumber, and hoisin sauce on the side. Enjoy!</li>
