        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat 1 cup of the coconut milk over medium heat. 
                Add the Massam curry paste and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste is 
                fragrant and well combined with the coconut milk.</li>
            <li>Add the beef or lamb to the pot and stir to coat the meat with the 
                curry paste. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the meat is browned on all sides.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 1 cup of coconut milk, water, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, 
                palm sugar, tamarind paste, and fish sauce to the pot. Bring the mixture to 
                a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender.</li>
            <li>Add the potato, carrot, peas, and cherry tomatoes to the pot and continue to simmer 
                for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Remove the cinnamon stick and bay leaves from the pot and discard. Serve the Massam 
                curry hot, with rice or noodles. Enjoy!</li>
